A project about speech synthesis

I wanted to synthesize my own voice so I started using Audacity.
Audacity is free and has the abbility to analyse the spectrum of a file which you can then export into "spectrum.txt".
Afterwards I wrote some python scripts that went from calculating apmlitudes to reading "spectrum.txt" and combining multiple frequencies.
